<h1>All About Alyssa</h1>
<p>Welcome to my first ever GitHub website. I've made several websites before but only one other from custom code, and to be honest, it was designed using tables in Adobe Dreamweaver. This website is part of my Assignment 2 for my Principles of Web Design class given at the University of FLorida. Here you will learn a little about me, and maybe you'll learn something that surprises you!

<h2> What I Do</h2>
<p>I am a graphic designer with over a decade of professional experience in my field. Completely self taught, I built up my portfolio and managed to land a job as a Production Artist for an international nursing scrubs brands. I did get a double major in Advertsing and Marketing from Florida State University, but by the time I learned Graphic Design was a career, I was a semester away from graduation. I taught myself the basics over the years and managed to get a foot in when Uniform Advantage took a chance on me. From there, I had several other jobs before landing my dream job two years ago at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. I was going to relocate when I learned last year I had cancer. I am now in remission, but decided not to relocate after all. Luckily, I am able to work remotely as their Visual Information Specialist and occaisional Project Manager/Art Director across several campaigns and centers.
