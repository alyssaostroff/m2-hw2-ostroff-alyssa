<h1>All About Alyssa</h1>
<p>Welcome to my first ever GitHub website. I've made several websites before but only one other from custom code, and to be honest, it was designed using tables in Adobe Dreamweaver. This website is part of my Assignment 2 for my Principles of Web Design class given at the University of FLorida. Here you will learn a little about me, and maybe you'll learn something that surprises you!
